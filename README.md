# Chess Move Generator

This is a chess move generator program and has the necessary data structures to eventually become a full fledged chess playing engine. This program was inspired by my love for programming and chess. This was a fun project. I knew I wanted to write this in old school C and create a more traditional symbolic aritificial intelligence program. IMO, the modern reinforcement learning chess playing programs just aren't as cool, but they obviously have superior chess playing strength.

I took inspiration by reading the chess programming wiki and reading the code of some other engines. In particular, Tom's Simple Chess Program (TSCP) proved to be an invaluable resource.

My program was tested using the infamous performance tests (perft). I used perft 1 - 6 and tested at depths within reason for my poor bitty box. There were many abends along the way, but this program ultimately proved a fun task. I hope to have time to finish the full playing engine someday when I can muster up enough computrons.

But until then, enjoy and drop me a note on improvements/bugs if you wish!

Happy hacking,
ECE
